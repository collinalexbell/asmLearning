Listing 2.3 shows that the assembler will assign the location 00000000(16) to the main symbol and also the mesg symbol. Why does this not cause problems?

The location number is not an absolute number, but rather a number that is relative to the section. Since mesg and main are in 2 seperate sections (.data and .text), the 2 variables will have different absolute locations despite having the same location relative to their section.
