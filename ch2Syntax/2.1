What is the difference between?

a) .data and .bss
	.data is used to store data constants in the assembled code itself
	.bss is only used to allocate space where constants will be stored, but does not initalize them to anything
	.bss takes up O(1) space in the resulting object file, because memory is not actually initialized

b) .ascii and .asciz
	.ascii is not null terminated
	.asciz is null terminated

c) .word and .long
	On the aarch64 architecture, both allocate/initalize 4 bytes. On other archs, this may not be the case.
