What is the purpose of .align?
	.align is a directive that ensures the next block of memory allocated/initialized begins on an apporopriate memory boundary.

What does .align 2 do in GNU AArch64 assembly?
	This enures that the next block of memory is allocated on a word boundry. That is, the memory will be allocated 0 to 3 bytes away from the previous memory location.
	The equation that dictates where the memory will be allocated is as follows curMemLoc + (4-curMemLoc%4)%4.
